üîß Settings Section ‚Äì Configuration Instructions
Hello, The Settings menu option is already added, but no system is configured yet. Please implement the following logic:

1. Purpose of Settings
The Settings section will control all selection menu options used across the system.

From here, Admin can add, edit, or delete the values that appear in dropdowns (selection menus) in both:

Traffic ‚Üí Add Traffic form

Filtering sections

2. Selection Menus to be Managed from Settings
Advanced Info (Traffic Form)
Priority (Selection menu)

Status (Selection menu)

Profession (Selection menu)

Job Type (Selection menu)

Marital Status (Selection menu)

Gender (Selection menu)

Permanent Country (Selection menu)

Permanent City (Selection menu)

Present Country (Selection menu)

Present City (Selection menu)

Height (Selection menu)

Qualification (Selection menu)

Organization (Selection menu)

Religion (Selection menu)

Social Title (Selection menu)

Payment Info (Traffic Form)
Package Type (Selection menu)

Payment Method (Selection menu)

3. System Logic
Detection

All dropdown fields that are common between the Add Traffic form and Filtering section must be detected and linked.

Example: If ‚ÄúProfession‚Äù is updated in Settings, it should update in both the form and the filtering section automatically.

Add Option

Admin can add new values (e.g., new Profession, new City, new Qualification).

Once added, the new option should immediately appear in the related dropdowns.

Delete Option

Admin can delete any previously added option.

Once deleted, it should be removed from all related dropdowns.

Display

All existing options must be listed in the Settings section under their respective categories.

Example: Under ‚ÄúProfession‚Äù ‚Üí show all professions currently available, with options to Add New or Delete.

4. Role-Based Access
Super Admin ‚Üí Full access (Add, Delete, View).

Other Roles ‚Üí View only (cannot add or delete).

5. UI/UX Requirements
Settings page should be clean, professional, and compact.

Each category (Profession, City, Qualification, etc.) should be displayed in a card or collapsible section.

Each section must have:

List of existing options

Add New button

Delete button beside each option

‚úÖ Please configure the Settings section so that all dropdown values across the system are centrally managed from here. This will ensure consistency and easy updates.
